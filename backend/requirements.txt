 # scikit-learn is optional. If you have a real model saved as joblib (trained with scikit-learn),
 # place it at backend/models/taxi_gb_model.joblib and the server will load it. Installing
 # scikit-learn on some Python versions (e.g. 3.13) may attempt to compile from source; if
 # you want to use a trained model, install a Python version with compatible wheels (e.g. 3.10/3.11)
# Allow pip to pick a numpy wheel compatible with the local Python version
